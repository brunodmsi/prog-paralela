# Horse Racing
Part of a college activity using threads, the command was: 
```
Create a horse race using thread
```
But instead, I created not only a horse race, but a story full of emotions.

## How to use?
You must have the GCC compiler installed in your computer.   
Then, you can create the executable using
```
make
```
and to run the executable, you just run `./horse-race` and you can finally enjoy the story.
